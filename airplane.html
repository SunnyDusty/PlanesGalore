                    <p>It's time to identify airplanes! Airplanes listed here are the basic comercial aircraft
                    that you would most likely see at airports. Sometimes it's difficult to see which aircraft is what
                    but usually there are differences, you just have to look close!
                    <hr>
                    <h1> <i>Boeing Vs. Airbus</i></h1>
                    The names of the aircraft depend on whether or not the plane is a Boeing or an Airbus.
                    They are two different aircraft industries, like different candy bar brands like Hersheys or Kitkat.
                    Boeing aircraft start with a B in front of the name like B777. And in aviation, 777 would be said as
                    triple seven. When you see a B with numbers, you wouldn't say 'B' 777, you would say Boeing 777.
                    It is the same as Airbus except an A is present in front of the numbers for example A350. You would
                    also pronounce it as Airbus a three fifty. Not airbus a three five zero. For Airbus, you do say the a
                    but for Boeing you do not say the b in pronounciation.
                    <hr>
                    A Boeing aircraft typically have a sharp nose, while Airbus aircraft have a round nose in the
                    front of the plane. However, this is not the case for some airplanes so it's very important to look at
                    other distict features of the airplane.

            <h3>A330</h3>
            <p>
                An Airbus plane. A twin-engine airplane with a sharp and upright nose. Has a total of 8 rotating wheels. 4 on each side. Only has one winglet on the wing. The cockpit windows are a little bit rounded,
                giving it a difference from Boeing.

            <h3>A340</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most rarest aircraft to see at an airport. Many airlines discontinue this aircraft in their fleet
                because of the unnessesary 4 engines, with only one row of seats. It is the only aircraft that flys today with
                4 engines that only has 1 row of seats. Very few airlines still carry this aircraft because it has bad fuel effiency.

            <h3>B767</h3>
            <p>
                The not as popular Boeing aircraft. The cockpit windows are shapped a little bit differently than a normal
                boeing. They are just a tiny bit rounder. This plane also sometimes has or doesn't have winglets. The nose isn't as sharp with a gradual
                decline.
